Big O Shorthands 

- Arithmetic operations are constant 
- Variable assignment is constant
- Accessing elements is an array (by index) or object (by key) is constant
- In a loop, the complexity is length of whatever happens inside of the loop

** The timeor space complexity depends on the algorithm, not the hardware used to run the algorithm.(as measured by Big O)

** Time complexity **

O(1) -> O(log(n)) -> O(n) -> O(n(log(n))) -> O(n2)
Best --------------------------------------- Worst

** Space complexity **

- Most Primitives(boolean , numbers , undefined, null) are constant space.
- Strings require O(n) space (where n is the string length)
- Reference type are generally O(n), where n is the length (for arrays) or the number of keys (for objects)
