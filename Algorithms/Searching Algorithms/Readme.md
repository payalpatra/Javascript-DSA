# Searching Algorithms

## Linear Search

It is a searching method that checks each element of the list until a match is found. A Linear Search makes at most n comparisons.

### Applications

- Perform single search in Unordered List
- Preprocess the list in order to use a faster Mehtod

### Time Complexity

```sh
Best Case -- O(1)
Worst Case -- O(N)
Average Case -- O(N)
```

## Binary Search

It is a searching algorithm that finds the position of a target value within a sorted array. The binary search algorithm works by repeatedly splitting the sorted list into two and working on the part of the list that may contain the target item until the final list contains only one element.

### Applications

- To find the lower/upper bound in an ordered sequence
- Find a Name in Phone Book

### Time Complexity

```sh
Best Case -- O(1)
Worst Case -- O(log n)
Average Case -- O(log n)
```
