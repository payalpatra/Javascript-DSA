What is an algorithm ?
- A process or set of sets to accomplish a certain task.
- It is the foundation for being successful problem solving and development.

Problem solving approach :-

1) Understand the problem
---- Can I restate the problem in your own words?
---- What are the inputs that go into the problem ?
---- What are the outputs that should come from the solution to the problem ?
---- Can the outputs be determined from the inputs? In other words, do i have enough information to solve the problem? 
---- How should i label the important pieces of the data that are a part of the problem ?

2) Explore Concrete Examples
---- Start with simple example
---- Progress to more complex example
---- Explore Example with empty inputs
---- Explore Example with invalid inputs

3) Break it Down

4) Solve/Simplify
5) Look Back And Refactor
