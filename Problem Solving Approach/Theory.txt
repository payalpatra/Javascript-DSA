- A process or set of sets to accomplish a certain task.
- It is the foundation for being successful problem solving and development.

Problem solving approach :-

- Understand the problem
---- Can I restate the problem in your own words?
---- What are the inputs that go into the problem ?
---- What are the outputs that should come from the solution to the problem ?
---- Can the outputs be determined from the inputs? In other words, do i have enough information to solve the problem? 
---- How should i label the important pieces of the data that are a part of the problem ?

- Explore Concrete Examples
- Break it Down
- Solve/Simplify
- Look Back And Refactor
