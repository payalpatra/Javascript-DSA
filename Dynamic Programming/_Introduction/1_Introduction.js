// --- What is Dynammic Programming --- \\ ?

// -- Dynamic Programming refers to simplifying a decision by breaking it down into sequence of decision steps over time.
// -- Example : Matrix Chain multiplication. Dynamic Programming is a powerful technique that can be used to solve many problems in time O(n2) or O(N3) for which a naive approach would take expontial time.
// -- Principle : Dynamic Programming computes its solution buttom up by synthesizing them from smaller subsolutions and by trying many possibilities and choices before it arrives at the optimal set of choices.

// ----- How to Identify Dynamic Programming ?

// 1) Choice should be given 
// 2) Recursive --> 2 calls
// 3) Optimal - (Min, Max, largest)

// ----- APPROACH ----- \\
